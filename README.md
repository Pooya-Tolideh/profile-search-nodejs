# Treehouse Profile Search

Treehouse has been one of the most useful places for me to learning development techniques from. 

They provide students with a public API that allows anyone to fetch a student's basic data (username and badges) through a json file. 

The node app built in this project fetches that data upon entering a username and presents it in a user-friendly manner in shape of an info card.

*Note* : This app has no npm dependencies. Just enter `node app.js` to run the code and then go to `localhost:3000`.
